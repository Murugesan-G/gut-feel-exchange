Hello Everyone,

Mahesh already tested other bug fixes and new requirements and confirmed that all are working as expected.
Only Delete Functionality in Member Form and Guest Bill Form needs to be test by Mahesh.

Completed bug fixed and new requirements:
1) InActive member Should not show in any other form except Member Search Form
2) Liquor Order Form data entry mistake
3) Liquor Report = Based on selected date. Like Liquor Today's Report, need a new report which user can able to select the Report Date.
4) Delete Option required for Guest Bill with confirmation message.
5) In Member Details form while deleting confirmation message should show.
6) If members have pending liquor due then Liquor order should not take. It should show error message and it shold not allow to order.
7) SMS should send from "SMS" form.

For SMS service, subscription in "https://api.textlocal.in". API is free from this vendor.
But based on number of message we need to buy number of messages from this vendor.

Apart from bug fix and new requirements, Liquor Bill Number need to reset to "1".
For this requirement we need to follow the below steps:
>> Need to take Database Backup as NTCYSTAGING_2022.
>> Clear all transaction details but should keep Master Data like Club, Member, Liquor Name, etc., Reset the Bill Number to "1"

We had taken the list of member details like Membername, MembershipNo in excel sheet.
Mahesh will reset the Membership number in the excel sheet to new membership number and we will upload the same into the new database.

Hello Mahesh Sir,
Yesterday I've deployed all the Bug Fixes and New Requirements in the application.
Modified version of the application has moved to "Live" and it's working as expected.

I'm working on SMS configuration issue and will update to you.
Shall I reset the bill number to "1" now or "01-Apr-2023"? Please check and confirm.

Please test the application and let me know if you are getting any errors.

Hello Mahesh,
I had a discussion with TextLocal support team.
They are asking whether we did DLT Registration or not.
From their record, NTCYNK account registered with DLT-Videocon.
Since the registration and configuration not been done in DLT, all the templates are in "Rejected" status.
May I know who has configured DLT-Videocon earlier. I need the login URL, User Name and Password to continue further.

For total mismatch issue, I found that the issue in OrderId "257784" and "257785".
These orders not paid due to wrong MembershipNo "97".
Actual MembershipNo is 57 and OrderId is 257816.
Reason is Liquor "BREEZER CRANBERRY" ordered only by the MembershipNo 57. 
So confirmed that 97 is misplaced with 57.

After deleting the wrong entry from database, the total is matching in both reports

Eventhough the MembershipNo 97 not available in application accepting the wrong MembershipNo.
I'm working on this issue.
